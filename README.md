# Web Scraping and EDA project on Analysis on Different Specilization of Doctors 
This project is regarding analysis on different specilization of doctors using Practo.com website.

We did this project as a team of two members. First we have collected the data from Practo.com website based on our requirements by right clicking particular data and inspected that and parsed the html code from it.
We totally selected six cities and seven doctor specilizations to scrape the data. We have collected totally 2482 and 8 columns as raw data. After that we have cleaned the unwanted data by using mode and replace to fill the Null values. After cleaning the data we have collected totally 882 rows and 8 columns. We have exported the cleaned data into csv file for data analysis and further processing.
In data analysis we have used univarite, bivariate and multivariate analysis and explored the data in plots.
Finally we did the power point presentation on the above data analysis.
